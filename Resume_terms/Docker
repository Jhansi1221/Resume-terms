using Docker, we  donâ€™t have to install and configure complex databases nor worry about switching between incompatible language toolchain versions. 

When an app is dockerized, that complexity is pushed into containers that are easily built, shared and run. 

Onboarding a co-worker to a new codebase no longer means hours spent installing software and explaining setup procedures. 

Code that ships with Dockerfiles is simpler to work on: Dependencies are pulled as neatly packaged Docker images and anyone with Docker and an editor installed can build and debug the app in minutes.
