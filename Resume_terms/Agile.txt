1) Explain what is Model-View-Controller?

MVC is a software architecture pattern for developing web application. It is handled by three objects Model-View-Controller.

2) Mention what does Model-View-Controller represent in an MVC application?

In an MVC model,

Model– It represents the application data domain. In other words applications business logic is contained within the model and is responsible for maintaining data
View– It represents the user interface, with which the end users communicates. In short all the user interface logic is contained within the VIEW
Controller– It is the controller that answers to user actions. Based on the user actions, the respective controller responds within the model and choose a view to render that display the user interface.  The user input logic is contained with-in the controller
3) Explain in which assembly is the MVC framework is defined?

The MVC framework is defined in System.Web.Mvc.

4) List out few different return types of a controller action method?

View Result
Javascript Result
Redirect Result
Json Result
Content Result
5) Mention what is the difference between adding routes, to a webform application and an MVC application?

To add routes to a webform application, we can use MapPageRoute() method of the RouteCollection class, where adding routes to an MVC application, you can use MapRoute() method.

6) Mention what are the two ways to add constraints to a route?

The two methods to add constraints to a route is

Use regular expressions
Use an object that implements IRouteConstraint Interface
7) Mention what is the advantages of MVC?

MVC segregates your project into a different segment, and it becomes easy for developers to work on
It is easy to edit or change some part of your project that makes project less development and maintenance cost
MVC makes your project more systematic
8) Mention what “beforFilter()”,“beforeRender” and “afterFilter” functions do in Controller?

beforeFilter(): This function is run before every action in the controller. It’s the right place to check for an active session or inspect user permissions.
beforeRender(): This function is called after controller action logic, but before the view is rendered. This function is not often used, but may be required If you are calling render() manually before the end of a given action
afterFilter(): This function is called after every controller action, and after rendering is done. It is the last controller method to run
9) Explain the role of components Presentation, Abstraction and Control in MVC?


 
Presentation: It is the visual representation of a specific abstraction within the application
Abstraction: It is the business domain functionality within the application
Control: It is a component that keeps consistency between the abstraction within the system and their presentation to the user in addition to communicating with other controls within the system
10) Mention the advantages and disadvantages of MVC model?

Advantages	Disadvantages
It represents clear separation between business logic and presentation logic
Each MVC object has different responsibilities
The development progresses in parallel
Easy to manage and maintain
All classes and object are independent of each other
The model pattern is little complex
Inefficiency of data access in view
With modern user interface, it is difficult to use MVC
You need multiple programmers for parallel development
Multiple technologies knowledge is required
11) Explain the role of “ActionFilters” in MVC?

In MVC “ ActionFilters” help you to execute logic while MVC action is executed or its executing.

12) Explain what are the steps for the execution of an MVC project?

The steps for the execution of an MVC project includes

Receive first request for the application
Performs routing
Creates MVC request handler
Create Controller
Execute Controller
Invoke action
Execute Result
13) Explain what is routing? What are the three segments for routing is important?

Routing helps you to decide a URL structure and map the URL with the Controller.

The three segments that are important for routing is

ControllerName
ActionMethodName
Parameter
14) Explain how routing is done in MVC pattern?

There is a group of routes called the RouteCollection, which consists of registered routes in the application.  The RegisterRoutes method records the routes in this collection.  A route defines a URL pattern and a handler to use if the request matches the pattern. The first parameter to the MapRoute method is the name of the route. The second parameter will be the pattern to which the URL matches.  The third parameter might be the default values for the placeholders if they are not determined.


 
15) Explain using hyperlink how you can navigate from one view to other view?

By using “ActionLink” method as shown in the below code. The below code will make a simple URL which help to navigate to the “Home” controller and invoke the “GotoHome” action.

Collapse / Copy Code

<%= Html.ActionLink(“Home”, “Gotohome”) %>

16) Mention how can maintain session in MVC?

Session can be maintained in MVC by three ways tempdata, viewdata, and viewbag.

17) Mention what is the difference between Temp data, View, and View Bag?

Temp data: It helps to maintain data when you shift from one controller to other controller.
View data: It helps to maintain data when you move from controller to view
View Bag: It’s a dynamic wrapper around view data
18) What is partial view in MVC?

Partial view in MVC renders a portion of view content. It is helpful in reducing code duplication. In simple terms, partial view allows to render a view within the parent view.

19) Explain how you can implement Ajax in MVC?

In Ajax, MVC can be implemented in two ways

Ajax libraries
Jquery
20) Mention what is the difference between “ActionResult” and “ViewResult” ?

“ActionResult” is an abstract class while “ViewResult” is derived from “AbstractResult” class.  “ActionResult” has a number of derived classes like “JsonResult”, “FileStreamResult” and “ViewResult” .

“ActionResult” is best if you are deriving different types of view dynamically.

21) Explain how you can send the result back in JSON format in MVC?

In order to send the result back in JSON format in MVC, you can use “JSONRESULT” class.

22) Explain what is the difference between View and Partial View?

 

                            View	                               Partial View
It contains the layout page
Before any view is rendered, viewstart page is rendered
View might have markup tags like body, html, head, title, meta etc.
View is not lightweight as compare to Partial View
 It does not contain the layout page
Partial view does not verify for a viewstart.cshtml. We cannot put common code for a partial view within the viewStart.cshtml.page
Partial view is designed specially to render within the view and just because of that it does not consist any mark up
We can pass a regular view to the RenderPartial method
23) List out the types of result in MVC?

In MVC, there are twelve types of results in MVC where “ActionResult” class is the main class while the 11 are their sub-types

ViewResult
PartialViewResult
EmptyResult
RedirectResult
RedirectToRouteResult
JsonResult
JavaScriptResult
ContentResult
FileContentResult
FileStreamResult
FilePathResult
24) Mention what is the importance of NonActionAttribute?

All public methods of a controller class are treated as the action method if you want to prevent this default method then you have to assign the public method with NonActionAttribute.

25) Mention what is the use of the default route {resource}.axd/{*pathinfo} ?

This default route prevents request for a web resource file such as Webresource.axd or ScriptResource.axd from being passed to the controller.

26) Mention the order of the filters that get executed, if the multiple filters are implemented?

The filter order would be like

Authorization filters
Action filters
Response filters
Exception filters
27) Mention what filters are executed in the end?

In the end “Exception Filters” are executed.

28) Mention what are the file extensions for razor views?

For razor views the file extensions are

.cshtml: If C# is the programming language
.vbhtml: If VB is the programming language
29) Mention what are the two ways for adding constraints to a route?

Two methods for adding constraints to route is

Using regular expressions
Using an object that implements IRouteConstraint interface
30) Mention two instances where routing is not implemented or required?

Two instance where routing is not required are

When a physical file is found that matches the URL pattern
When routing is disabled for a URL pattern
31) Mention what are main benefits of using MVC?

There are two key benefits of using MVC

As the code is moved behind a separate class file, you can use the code to a great extent
As behind code is simply moved to.NET class, it is possible to automate UI testing. This gives an opportunity to automate manual testing and write unit tests.
